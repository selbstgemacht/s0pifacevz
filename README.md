# s0pifacevz

this script acts as a interface between a Raspberry Pi with PiFace Digital 2 and the software of www.volkszaehler.org and should be a replacement for vzlogger which seems no to be able to work with PiFace Digital 2

You need to install Piface Digital as described [here, https://www.element14.com/community/thread/39390/l/piface-digital-2-setup-and-use?displayFullThread=true ]. 

For further dependencies you need to

sudo apt-get install libgnutls28-dev libcurl3
pip install pycurl
